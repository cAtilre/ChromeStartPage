ChromeStartPage
===============

Custom start page and new tab page for Google Chrome.

How to add to Chrome:
* Go to chrome://extensions/ and check "Load unpacked extension". Navigate to the folder containing the files.

* In addition, drag the "newtab.html" file into Chrome. Then go to chrome://settings/ and click "Open a specific 
page or set of pages" under "On startup". Now click "Use current pages" and the page should appear.

* Uninstallation is the reverse of installation; change your home page back and uninstall the extension.
